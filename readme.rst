Trusted Firmware-A Tests
========================

The Trusted Firmware-A Tests (TF-A-Tests) is a suite of baremetal tests to
exercise the `Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A)`_ features from the Normal World. It
enables strong TF-A functional testing without dependency on a Rich OS. It
mainly interacts with TF-A through its SMC interface.

It provides a basis for TF-A developers to validate their own platform ports and
add their own test cases.

The following TF-A features are currently tested to some extent (this list is
not exhaustive):

-  `SMC Calling Convention`_
-  `Power State Coordination Interface (PSCI)`_
-  `Software Delegated Exception Interface (SDEI)`_
-  `Performance Measurement Framework (PMF)`_
-  Communication and interaction with the `Test Secure Payload (TSP)`_
-  `Firmware update`_ (or recovery mode)
-  `EL3 payload`_ boot flow
-  `Secure partition`_ support

These tests are not a compliance test suite for the Arm interface standards used
in TF-A (such as PSCI).

They do not cover 100% of the TF-A code. The fact that all tests pass does not
mean that TF-A is free of bugs.

They are not reference code. They should not be considered as the official way
to test hardware/firmware features. Instead, they are provided as example code
to experiment with and improve on.
